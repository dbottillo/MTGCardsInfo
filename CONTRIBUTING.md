## How to contribute

### Reporting bugs
Before reporting a bug, please check the existing issue of the project. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible, including:
* app version
* device model
* android operating system version

### Suggesting enhancements
If you are interested in a new feature or in fixing a bug, you are very welcome to open a new pull request against `dev` branch. Please be aware of:
* each PR should be linked to an issue in order to track changes properly
* writing test is mandatory for business logic but not for UI 
* use a clear and descriptive title
* describe what has changed and why
* screenshots and other resources are welcome
* PR should be small, ideally one commit for each PR (commit message should be something like `Close #123 : fix bug ....`
